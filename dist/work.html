        <h1>Work</h1>
        <p>
            If you're not here to find a good cause to give money, maybe you're looking to hire me.
            I'm not looking for a job right now, but in general that also rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have over a decade of experience building web apps from the ground up.
            I focus on back end and infrastructure, but also regularly write front end code.
            I have worked professionally in Python, Java, Kotlin, JS, TS, and Clojure.
            In my free time I like to work in Rust, Haskell, Zig, and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to contact me about any of that, try hiring at this domain.
            Otherwise, these are the more useful ways to find me.
        </p>

                I don't really have any reason to use javascript here, so you're not missing out.
